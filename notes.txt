get_distance_between_sprites - distance between the center of two given sprites, can be used as a fitness measure
checkpoints +5 fitness
finish line +100 fitness

x background research before the methodology
x Highlight the AI section, include a research
x Put what is a neural network in background research
x Flesh out game and add multiple levels for singleplayer, plus start and level complete screens
Going from javascript to python, then arcade to pygame
javascript game would have included having the ai watch the screen, whereas python lets it be a part of the game.
python arcade is good for physics stuff, but it quickly gets out of time with the neural network
pygame lets me keep time manually 

make a graph from the fitness of the generations
a successful neural network AI would show a positive correlation between generations and average fitness
may be linear, exponential or diminishing

give the game to 10 players, get them to play the levels 10 times and get their time from each attempt
graph the average of attempt 1, attempt 2 etc and compare to smart ai times
maybe even compare to dummies

if you can't find anything on neural networks applications in games, just say that you couldnt

moved all interactibles into one group instead of mutliple to improve performance

added 'view' of the smart ai so it can detect things infront of it

Lots of references
Introduction about how neural networks are currently being applied
                short sentence on how they can be applied to video games

Background research of What is a neural network
        how are neural networks applied to video games at the moment and how could they be
        why I have chosen this topic


No references
Methodology is what choices I've made
                comparison to why I haven't made other choices

Product description is what I have made
            requirements:
                Needs to be playable by a single player or by the AI and have the same rules
                Ai needs to learn over time and improve

Critical review is talking about how it went
            talk about feedback from questionaires
            talk about what I think went well
            talk about what I think could be improved update_animation

Reference EVERYTHING

Appendix 1: meeting email
Appendix 2: Github link
Appendix 3: questionaire link

Do the abstract once the report is finished

12/05:  Just get methodology and Product description done first. Come back to research and intro
        Send out the game and questionaire ASAP
