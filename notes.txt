get_distance_between_sprites - distance between the center of two given sprites, can be used as a fitness measure
checkpoints +5 fitness
finish line +100 fitness

background research before the methodology
Highlight the AI section, include a research
Put what is a neural network in background research
Flesh out game and add multiple levels for singleplayer, plus start and level complete screens
Going from javascript to python, then arcade to pygame
javascript game would have included having the ai watch the screen, whereas python lets it be a part of the game.
python arcade is good for physics stuff, but it quickly gets out of time with the neural network
pygame lets me keep time manually 

make a graph from the fitness of the generations
a successful neural network AI would show a positive correlation between generations and average fitness
may be linear, exponential or diminishing

give the game to 10 players, get them to play the levels 10 times and get their time from each attempt
graph the average of attempt 1, attempt 2 etc and compare to smart ai times
maybe even compare to dummies

if you can't find anything on neural networks applications in games, just say that you couldnt

moved all interactibles into one group instead of mutliple to improve performance

added 'view' of the smart ai so it can detect things infront of it
